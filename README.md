This api contains 31000+ cbse school data, like names, district, address, etc., including inauguration_date with current principal details across India. The data is sourced from the CBSE Saras website.

> You can download the entire data-set from the `data/` folder after running the grab scripts.

> Note: This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by any government entity. Data comes from publicly available pages and may change or break at any time.

## 🚀 Available Endpoints

- 👉 [GET - /api/schools - List all CBSE Schools](https://cbse-schools.netlify.app/api/schools)
- 👉 [GET - /api/schools/{affiliatedId} - Get Detailed School Info](https://cbse-schools.netlify.app/api/schools/1930706)

> Calling `/api/schools` will return the offline snapshot from `data/schools.json` (several MB). Prefer filtered calls (by state/district/status) for faster responses.

- The downloader/merge scripts write per-status files and a merged snapshot at `data/schools.json`. Each per-status file has a `meta` object with `count` and `last_grabbed` timestamps. The merged file contains `meta` with `statuses` and `total_unique`.
